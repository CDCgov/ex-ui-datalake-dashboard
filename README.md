# Example Datalake UI Dashboard
The purpose of this example app is to show how you can use the [fdns-ms-object](https://github.com/cdcgov/fdns-ms-object) and [fdns-ms-indexing](https://github.com/cdcgov/fdns-ms-indexing) services with a front-end interface built with [fdns-ui-react](https://github.com/cdcgov/fdns-ui-react) and [fdns-js-sdk](https://github.com/cdcgov/fdns-js-sdk). The use case for this example app is to view and index objects from the Datalake. You can also download data summaries via the [fdns-ms-reporting](https://github.com/cdcgov/fdns-ms-reporting) and [fdns-ms-storage](https://github.com/cdcgov/fdns-ms-storage) services.

## Running Locally

### Before you start
You will need to have the following installed before getting up and running locally:

- Docker, [Installation guides](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- Docker Compose, [Installation guides](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **Windows Users**: This project uses `Make`, please see [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) for running commands in this README

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of the Create React App guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

### Installation

This app uses the following FDNS libraries hosted on `npm`.

* [FDNS React UI](https://gitlab.com/fdns/fdns-ui-react.git)

Run `npm i` to install dependencies.

### Run

To start the background processes necessary, run docker compose to spin up `fdns-ms-indexing`, `fdns-ms-hl7-object`, `fdns-ms-storage`, and `fdns-ms-reporting`, which are all needed to run this app:

    docker-compose up -d

To start the app:

    npm start

You should be able to visit `http://localhost:3000/` to view the dashboard.

To stop running the docker background images:

	docker-compose down

### Secure Mode

This app is able to run in a configuration where a OAuth 2.0 access token is needed before accessing the front-end such as with Foundation Services running with OAuth 2.0 enabled. You can pass the following environment variables to your Docker container:

- `SECURE_MODE=true` to run in the secure mode configuration
- `AUTH_URL=https://authorization-server.com/oauth/authorize` the value for the authorization URL from your OAuth 2.0 provider

Your `AUTH_URL` should follow the [general guidelines for a Single Page App](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/single-page-apps/).
The following is an example of what this URL might look like and how your `redirect_uri` should be formatted:

```
https://authorization-server.com/oauth/authorize
	?client_id=REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT_ID
	&response_type=code
	&state=REPLACE_WITH_STATE
	&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample-app.com%2Fauth
```
